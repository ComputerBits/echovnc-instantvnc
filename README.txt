                  Released: 16 October 2010
                  =========================

INTRODUCTION
------------
InstantVNC(TM) is a remote support application that allows support
providers to connect to remote PC's across the Internet, regardless
of routing, firewalling, or web-proxying. InstantVNC accomplishs this 
by use of the echoWare(R) toolkit, which allows InstantVNC connections
to be "relayed" via an echoServer(R) application. InstantVNC requires
no installation, and leaves no permanent files on the PC's it runs on.

By default, InstantVNC displays our "splash screen" graphic at 
startup, and connects to our demo echoServer. It is easily customizable,
however, to display your graphics, or connect to your echoSevrer. Just
hold down the SHIFT key when starting up InstantVNC to access the
customization UI. All changes you make are saved "within" the InstantVNC
application so that you can redistribute the resulting binary to your
remote support clients.

This version of InstantVNC uses version 1.999.18 of echoWare, which
includes support for 128-bit AES encryption of the VNC session. More 
info about echoWare and echoServers can be found here:
